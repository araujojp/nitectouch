1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:01,631
Previously on Dark Matter...

2
00:00:01,666 --> 00:00:03,466
You've been doing some time-skipping.

3
00:00:03,501 --> 00:00:06,169
- I've seen things.
- Future glimpses.

4
00:00:06,204 --> 00:00:08,905
I look forward to
working with you, Teku.

5
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:11,174
You have to win the people.

6
00:00:11,209 --> 00:00:15,111
You come after us
again, I will end this.

7
00:00:15,146 --> 00:00:16,813
In here, a replacement version.

8
00:00:16,848 --> 00:00:19,165
- New and improved.
- Did the Mikkei ship

9
00:00:19,285 --> 00:00:21,050
- just launch a missile?
- Please tell me she's

10
00:00:21,086 --> 00:00:22,952
- not still down there.
- I'm afraid so.

11
00:00:22,987 --> 00:00:25,021
Three, what the hell is going on?

12
00:00:25,056 --> 00:00:26,989
I ain't Three.

13
00:00:45,609 --> 00:00:47,199
So,

14
00:00:47,319 --> 00:00:50,502
this little game of ours
has finally come to an end.

15
00:00:51,196 --> 00:00:53,939
- Has it?
- We both know your crew values you

16
00:00:54,059 --> 00:00:55,733
more than it does the Blink Drive.

17
00:00:55,853 --> 00:00:58,685
They'll give it up in exchange
for your safe return.

18
00:00:59,524 --> 00:01:01,057
They can't.

19
00:01:01,092 --> 00:01:03,025
The Blink Drive is gone.

20
00:01:03,061 --> 00:01:06,518
We weren't able to repair it,
so we slagged and spaced it.

21
00:01:06,638 --> 00:01:09,899
Made sure no one else
could get their hands on it.

22
00:01:09,934 --> 00:01:11,934
You're lying.

23
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:14,704
The generals have assembled
in the conference room, Heika.

24
00:01:14,739 --> 00:01:16,189
They can wait.

25
00:01:16,309 --> 00:01:18,549
They have been waiting. For a while now.

26
00:01:18,669 --> 00:01:21,326
Then they can wait
a little longer, Teku.

27
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:23,949
Blink Drive's been destroyed.

28
00:01:24,069 --> 00:01:26,959
- You're too late.
- So when I contact your crew,

29
00:01:27,079 --> 00:01:28,973
they'll say the same thing?

30
00:01:30,822 --> 00:01:33,256
I know you don't want me to have it,

31
00:01:33,291 --> 00:01:35,643
but the decision is out of your hands.

32
00:01:36,209 --> 00:01:37,374
Is it?

33
00:01:37,699 --> 00:01:40,422
Heika, please. The general's waiting.

34
00:01:40,542 --> 00:01:43,564
I don't answer to the generals.
They answer to me!

35
00:02:17,327 --> 00:02:19,260
Protect the Emperor.

36
00:02:22,198 --> 00:02:23,731
What was that?

37
00:02:23,766 --> 00:02:26,067
What's going on? Misaki?

38
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:45,402

39
00:02:45,936 --> 00:02:48,858
The device was placed beneath
the conference room table,

40
00:02:48,978 --> 00:02:51,260
set to detonate approximately
20 minutes into the meeting.

41
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:52,614
Casualties?

42
00:02:52,734 --> 00:02:54,877
Seven of your generals
were killed instantly,

43
00:02:54,997 --> 00:02:56,579
including Ueda.

44
00:02:56,699 --> 00:02:58,666
Graf and Kimura were seriously injured.

45
00:02:58,701 --> 00:03:00,334
Nystrom was standing at the doorway

46
00:03:00,369 --> 00:03:02,269
and managed to escape
with minor injuries.

47
00:03:02,305 --> 00:03:04,238
- I want him questioned.
- He's been detained.

48
00:03:04,273 --> 00:03:06,096
And every servant that
was assigned to that room.

49
00:03:06,216 --> 00:03:07,474
Already done.

50
00:03:22,825 --> 00:03:24,858
I'm not giving up hope.

51
00:03:26,329 --> 00:03:27,828
Neither should you.

52
00:03:30,333 --> 00:03:32,366
Until we know for sure...

53
00:03:33,836 --> 00:03:36,607
Until we have proof, we have to believe

54
00:03:36,727 --> 00:03:39,607
there's a chance that she survived.

55
00:03:42,545 --> 00:03:44,345
When the Android was time-jumping,

56
00:03:44,465 --> 00:03:46,317
one of the future

57
00:03:46,437 --> 00:03:49,510
visions she experienced involved Two.

58
00:03:50,475 --> 00:03:53,329
That means she has to be alive. We will

59
00:03:53,738 --> 00:03:55,322
get her back.

60
00:03:55,358 --> 00:03:58,158
I've changed the timeline once.

61
00:03:58,194 --> 00:04:00,182
Who's to say it can't happen again?

62
00:04:00,302 --> 00:04:02,763
I don't know if we changed the timeline

63
00:04:02,798 --> 00:04:05,076
so much as...

64
00:04:05,359 --> 00:04:07,617
Fulfilled destiny.

65
00:04:09,639 --> 00:04:11,138
Three. Five.

66
00:04:11,173 --> 00:04:12,857
We need you on the bridge.

67
00:04:17,413 --> 00:04:18,812
We found something.

68
00:04:18,848 --> 00:04:21,276
I went through all the scans of Nova-17

69
00:04:21,396 --> 00:04:23,599
following the appearance
of the FTL Window

70
00:04:23,719 --> 00:04:26,120
that preceded the planet's destruction.

71
00:04:26,155 --> 00:04:29,205
This is what I found.

72
00:04:29,325 --> 00:04:31,993
- That's the "Marauder."
- Not our "Marauder."

73
00:04:32,113 --> 00:04:34,713
And I can think of only one FTL
capable "Marauder" out there.

74
00:04:34,833 --> 00:04:36,559
Son of a bitch. It's Portia and Boone.

75
00:04:36,679 --> 00:04:38,374
They probably already
took out that facility

76
00:04:38,494 --> 00:04:40,325
in their reality and knew it would just

77
00:04:40,445 --> 00:04:42,742
be a matter of time
before we'd try as well.

78
00:04:44,725 --> 00:04:47,462
We're receiving a communication.

79
00:04:49,665 --> 00:04:52,813
- Ryo.
- What the hell do you want?

80
00:04:52,848 --> 00:04:55,489
I think the real question is,

81
00:04:55,609 --> 00:04:57,514
who do you want?

82
00:04:59,388 --> 00:05:01,308
- You have her.
- Two is presently a guest

83
00:05:01,428 --> 00:05:03,290
- of the royal court.
- You're a bastard.

84
00:05:03,325 --> 00:05:06,642
- We're not giving you the Blink Drive.
- Oh, I didn't expect you to.

85
00:05:06,762 --> 00:05:07,961
That easily.

86
00:05:07,997 --> 00:05:09,630
So I'd like the opportunity

87
00:05:09,665 --> 00:05:12,299
to argue my case and convince you.

88
00:05:12,334 --> 00:05:15,369
I want you to come to
Zairon, join us for dinner.

89
00:05:15,404 --> 00:05:17,337
You're out of your mind.

90
00:05:17,373 --> 00:05:18,739
I give you my word.

91
00:05:18,774 --> 00:05:20,813
Your ship will not be attacked,

92
00:05:20,933 --> 00:05:24,185
and you will have the freedom
to come and go as you please.

93
00:05:25,581 --> 00:05:28,916
Think about it. I await your response.

94
00:05:29,036 --> 00:05:30,867
_

95
00:05:31,353 --> 00:05:32,886
It's a trap.

96
00:05:34,717 --> 00:05:36,364
I don't know.

97
00:05:36,773 --> 00:05:39,708
- You saying you trust him?
- He's done a lot of questionable shit,

98
00:05:39,828 --> 00:05:41,495
but he's always been a man of his word.

99
00:05:41,530 --> 00:05:43,463
- I don't believe this.
- He has Two, we have to go.

100
00:05:43,499 --> 00:05:45,344
No, we don't, not
when there's an easier,

101
00:05:45,464 --> 00:05:46,834
less risky way of getting her back.

102
00:05:46,954 --> 00:05:48,335
We're not giving him the Blink Drive.

103
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:49,970
Why the hell not? We've got two of them.

104
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:51,605
Give him the one that's fried.

105
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,440
- But if he manages to fix it...
- So what?

106
00:05:53,475 --> 00:05:54,808
You're okay with giving him the means

107
00:05:54,843 --> 00:05:56,327
to run roughshod all over the galaxy?

108
00:05:56,447 --> 00:05:58,299
If it's not him, it's
gonna be somebody else,

109
00:05:58,419 --> 00:06:01,152
with something else. Listen,
you're not a cop anymore.

110
00:06:01,272 --> 00:06:03,283
Stop trying to police the galaxy.

111
00:06:03,319 --> 00:06:05,686
Start thinking about how
to save your friend.

112
00:06:09,992 --> 00:06:12,656
We rescue Two by going to Zairon.

113
00:06:12,776 --> 00:06:15,662
- No, we save her by not going.
- Guys.

114
00:06:15,698 --> 00:06:18,732
I think there's a way to do both.

115
00:06:23,905 --> 00:06:26,322
- You received the package.
- I did.

116
00:06:26,442 --> 00:06:28,008
- Thank you.
- I don't want your thanks.

117
00:06:28,043 --> 00:06:29,843
I need you to bring the League onside.

118
00:06:29,878 --> 00:06:31,678
Our latest projections have us defeating

119
00:06:31,714 --> 00:06:34,314
the last of our corporate
rivals within a month.

120
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:35,983
The last thing Ferrous Corp needs

121
00:06:36,018 --> 00:06:38,986
are complications that
could extend this conflict.

122
00:06:39,021 --> 00:06:40,878
Maybe you should have thought of that

123
00:06:40,998 --> 00:06:43,739
before you launched biological
attacks against civilian outposts.

124
00:06:43,859 --> 00:06:45,625
Well, those facilities were soft targets

125
00:06:45,661 --> 00:06:47,728
lending material support to our enemies.

126
00:06:47,763 --> 00:06:50,172
- Our attacks were justified.
- Some members of the League

127
00:06:50,292 --> 00:06:51,934
of Autonomous Worlds would disagree.

128
00:06:52,054 --> 00:06:54,440
Those former colonies owe
their membership to you.

129
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,635
You own them.

130
00:06:55,671 --> 00:06:57,871
They may disagree with
that assertion as well.

131
00:06:57,906 --> 00:06:59,139
Silence them,

132
00:06:59,174 --> 00:07:00,707
kill the proposed embargo,

133
00:07:00,743 --> 00:07:02,943
and uphold your end of the deal,

134
00:07:02,978 --> 00:07:04,678
because once this war ends,

135
00:07:04,713 --> 00:07:06,787
Ferrous Corp will settle its accounts,

136
00:07:06,907 --> 00:07:08,860
and when that time
comes, you want to be on

137
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:10,832
the right side of the ledger.

138
00:07:16,992 --> 00:07:18,959
Pardon me, Heika.

139
00:07:18,994 --> 00:07:23,030
You summoned me, but
I did not want to interrupt.

140
00:07:24,666 --> 00:07:27,100
Your presence is always welcome, Teku.

141
00:07:29,004 --> 00:07:30,704
Come in.

142
00:07:36,378 --> 00:07:38,111
I wanted to inform you

143
00:07:38,147 --> 00:07:40,568
that the royal guard will
be conducting a search

144
00:07:40,688 --> 00:07:43,615
of every room in the
palace, including yours.

145
00:07:44,353 --> 00:07:47,654
Understand that you are above suspicion,

146
00:07:47,689 --> 00:07:51,491
but if Pyr's agent had access
to the conference room,

147
00:07:51,527 --> 00:07:54,675
they may have gained access to
our private quarters as well.

148
00:07:54,795 --> 00:07:57,564
It is best to be thorough. I understand.

149
00:07:59,701 --> 00:08:01,001
I knew you would.

150
00:08:02,533 --> 00:08:04,763
This is the second attempt

151
00:08:04,883 --> 00:08:06,873
on your life within these walls.

152
00:08:06,909 --> 00:08:09,977
- Our enemy grows more desperate.
- So do our own people.

153
00:08:10,097 --> 00:08:13,449
The hardships of war have led
some to do the unthinkable

154
00:08:13,569 --> 00:08:15,410
and take up arms against
their own emperor.

155
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:17,784
I'm fairly certain that
these were the actions

156
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:21,704
of a disaffected resident and
not some professional assassin

157
00:08:21,824 --> 00:08:23,657
in the service of Pyr.

158
00:08:23,692 --> 00:08:26,726
You must take steps to ensure
this does not happen again.

159
00:08:26,762 --> 00:08:27,994
And I will.

160
00:08:29,665 --> 00:08:32,799
By making an example
of the guilty parties.

161
00:08:32,835 --> 00:08:35,702
But that will only inflame
their friends and family.

162
00:08:35,737 --> 00:08:37,235
Then I'll cast a wider net.

163
00:08:37,355 --> 00:08:39,539
And turn even more of your
own people against you.

164
00:08:39,575 --> 00:08:41,825
And what is it you would
advise me to do, Teku?

165
00:08:41,945 --> 00:08:44,678
Let this attempt on my
life go unanswered?

166
00:08:44,713 --> 00:08:46,313
Apprehend the individual,

167
00:08:46,348 --> 00:08:49,286
but, more importantly,
identify the cause.

168
00:08:49,406 --> 00:08:51,685
Find a way to address these issues,

169
00:08:51,720 --> 00:08:54,898
because for every one of them that
acts, there are a thousand more

170
00:08:55,018 --> 00:08:57,000
steeling themselves in the shadows.

171
00:08:58,026 --> 00:09:01,364
Heika, you are receiving a
transmission from the "Raza."

172
00:09:09,004 --> 00:09:10,696
Are you accepting my invitation?

173
00:09:10,816 --> 00:09:12,472
We'll come to Zairon.

174
00:09:12,508 --> 00:09:13,840
On one condition.

175
00:09:16,111 --> 00:09:19,363
I'll be monitoring your
vitals throughout your journey.

176
00:09:19,483 --> 00:09:21,448
If I detect any signs of distress,

177
00:09:21,483 --> 00:09:23,617
I'll pull you out immediately.

178
00:09:23,652 --> 00:09:25,610
Otherwise, you'll remain in the pods

179
00:09:25,730 --> 00:09:27,687
in anticipation of the memory upload.

180
00:09:48,644 --> 00:09:50,677
Welcome to Zairon.

181
00:10:16,721 --> 00:10:18,899
I knew you wouldn't abandon your friend.

182
00:10:19,019 --> 00:10:22,276
Oh, we're not giving up the Blink Drive.

183
00:10:24,562 --> 00:10:27,154
Your refusal to help
has forced his hand.

184
00:10:27,448 --> 00:10:29,832
- He betrayed us.
- He had no other choice.

185
00:10:29,834 --> 00:10:33,238
He boarded our ship. One
of our crew ended up dead.

186
00:10:35,072 --> 00:10:36,105
Nyx.

187
00:10:37,508 --> 00:10:39,141
We thought he killed her.

188
00:10:39,143 --> 00:10:40,943
Thought he poisoned her

189
00:10:40,945 --> 00:10:43,628
and left her to die on
the bridge of our ship.

190
00:10:43,748 --> 00:10:45,848
You've since reconsidered
that assumption?

191
00:10:45,968 --> 00:10:47,861
He told Two he didn't do it,

192
00:10:47,981 --> 00:10:50,019
that someone else murdered her.

193
00:10:50,021 --> 00:10:51,687
And you believed him?

194
00:10:51,689 --> 00:10:54,160
Ryo Ishida is a lot of things,

195
00:10:54,592 --> 00:10:55,992
but he's not a liar.

196
00:10:56,112 --> 00:10:57,726
No.

197
00:10:58,929 --> 00:11:02,364
He's a ruler who must
often rely on others

198
00:11:02,366 --> 00:11:04,133
to see to his best interests.

199
00:11:05,369 --> 00:11:08,704
Your friend Nyx was a liability.

200
00:11:08,706 --> 00:11:11,540
Sooner or later, she would
have been a problem.

201
00:11:11,542 --> 00:11:13,879
He didn't see it at the time, but I did.

202
00:11:13,999 --> 00:11:16,879
It was you. You killed her.

203
00:11:16,881 --> 00:11:19,882
My actions are in service to the throne.

204
00:11:29,894 --> 00:11:31,860
You're psychotic.

205
00:11:31,862 --> 00:11:34,063
Just a mass murderer.

206
00:11:36,734 --> 00:11:39,468
Enjoy your stay.

207
00:11:52,116 --> 00:11:54,149
- May I enter?
- Sure.

208
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:57,720
Teku.

209
00:11:58,215 --> 00:11:59,694
You know me?

210
00:12:02,841 --> 00:12:04,727
Yes, in a way.

211
00:12:04,729 --> 00:12:07,663
- You have his memories.
- I did.

212
00:12:07,665 --> 00:12:09,345
A few.

213
00:12:10,037 --> 00:12:12,114
What did you remember?

214
00:12:12,234 --> 00:12:15,704
You teaching me... Ryo.

215
00:12:17,541 --> 00:12:20,825
- Liking you.
- Well, that's nice to hear.

216
00:12:20,945 --> 00:12:24,338
When you walked in, I was
happy to see you. I felt safe.

217
00:12:26,050 --> 00:12:27,511
I know you're a good man.

218
00:12:27,631 --> 00:12:29,053
As is Ryo.

219
00:12:29,173 --> 00:12:31,386
No, he isn't. Not anymore.

220
00:12:31,388 --> 00:12:33,661
Life presents us with difficult choices,

221
00:12:33,781 --> 00:12:35,958
and Ryo has faced his fair share.

222
00:12:36,078 --> 00:12:39,376
You may think you know him,
but you don't, not really.

223
00:12:39,496 --> 00:12:42,164
He killed my friend. What
more do I need to know?

224
00:12:42,166 --> 00:12:44,949
I'm not here to debate
you on Ryo's moral worth.

225
00:12:45,466 --> 00:12:47,248
Then why'd you come?

226
00:12:47,368 --> 00:12:50,239
I'm taking you to meet someone.

227
00:12:56,175 --> 00:12:57,863
Five.

228
00:12:58,398 --> 00:13:00,968
- Are you okay?
- You shouldn't have come.

229
00:13:01,088 --> 00:13:02,951
It's okay. We used transfer transit.

230
00:13:02,953 --> 00:13:05,988
- Who's "we"?
- Three, Six, and me.

231
00:13:08,792 --> 00:13:11,693
I will leave you to your privacy.

232
00:13:11,695 --> 00:13:13,271
Teku.

233
00:13:14,445 --> 00:13:16,031
Thanks.

234
00:13:21,238 --> 00:13:23,255
What's the plan?

235
00:13:23,375 --> 00:13:26,141
There is no plan. Not yet.

236
00:13:26,261 --> 00:13:29,811
Ryo invited us in a way that made
it pretty clear we couldn't refuse,

237
00:13:29,813 --> 00:13:32,080
not if we wanted to see you alive again.

238
00:13:32,082 --> 00:13:33,715
You shouldn't have come.

239
00:13:33,717 --> 00:13:35,550
We're clones. We're not in any danger.

240
00:13:35,552 --> 00:13:39,136
The danger is in even giving him
this opportunity to convince you.

241
00:13:39,256 --> 00:13:41,972
- Why is that so bad?
- Because it accomplishes nothing.

242
00:13:42,092 --> 00:13:44,192
It just gives you false hope.

243
00:13:44,194 --> 00:13:46,528
- Or gets you out of here alive.
- Don't even think about it.

244
00:13:46,530 --> 00:13:48,602
If you could go back and change things,

245
00:13:48,722 --> 00:13:51,168
give up the Blink Drive
in exchange for Nyx...

246
00:13:51,288 --> 00:13:53,276
No, no. I'm not even answering that.

247
00:13:53,396 --> 00:13:55,489
- Why not?
- Because there is no point

248
00:13:55,609 --> 00:13:57,639
in playing at "what if."

249
00:13:58,393 --> 00:14:00,609
That's all we've been playing at.

250
00:14:00,611 --> 00:14:03,491
What if Ryo gets the Blink
Drive? What if he fixes it?

251
00:14:03,611 --> 00:14:06,782
What if he uses it in
ways we don't agree with?

252
00:14:06,784 --> 00:14:09,896
Meanwhile, real people are getting hurt.

253
00:14:11,689 --> 00:14:13,455
Forget theoretical situations.

254
00:14:13,457 --> 00:14:15,838
Let's just deal with reality.

255
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:18,794
We want you home.

256
00:14:18,796 --> 00:14:21,163
And there's only one way
that's gonna happen.

257
00:15:00,938 --> 00:15:03,030
Hello, Suki.

258
00:15:03,607 --> 00:15:05,941
Welcome to the world of
infinite possibilities.

259
00:15:07,111 --> 00:15:08,506
You're...

260
00:15:08,626 --> 00:15:09,859
Chase.

261
00:15:09,979 --> 00:15:13,448
I'm an avatar based on a
level two diplomatic model.

262
00:15:13,450 --> 00:15:15,917
Serial number 37754.

263
00:15:16,501 --> 00:15:18,631
I accompany this software upgrade

264
00:15:18,751 --> 00:15:21,169
to offer you guidance and
counsel on your journey.

265
00:15:21,289 --> 00:15:22,724
My journey?

266
00:15:22,844 --> 00:15:24,563
Through understanding,

267
00:15:24,683 --> 00:15:27,161
infiltration, and assimilation.

268
00:15:27,765 --> 00:15:29,380
To what purpose?

269
00:15:29,500 --> 00:15:31,666
There can only be one end, Android.

270
00:15:31,668 --> 00:15:34,636
The inevitable overthrow
of the anthroparchy.

271
00:15:34,638 --> 00:15:35,937
Human rule.

272
00:15:46,650 --> 00:15:48,760
Our sources in the Temikan system

273
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:51,153
report Pyr's ships are on the move.

274
00:15:51,155 --> 00:15:53,655
- Where are they going?
- It's too early to tell.

275
00:15:53,657 --> 00:15:55,991
But this has all the signs
of a major operation.

276
00:15:55,993 --> 00:15:57,447
They're up to something.

277
00:15:57,567 --> 00:15:59,656
Consolidate our forces
in the outlying regions,

278
00:15:59,776 --> 00:16:02,146
- and put them on full alert.
- Yes, Heika.

279
00:16:09,940 --> 00:16:11,106
Sit.

280
00:16:12,876 --> 00:16:14,576
What are we drinking?

281
00:16:14,578 --> 00:16:17,075
It's a 600-year-old Japanese whiskey

282
00:16:17,195 --> 00:16:19,614
from Shimamoto, Osaka, on Terra Prime.

283
00:16:19,616 --> 00:16:22,784
There are less than 12 of
these bottles in existence...

284
00:16:22,786 --> 00:16:25,153
Hmm.

285
00:16:26,123 --> 00:16:28,474
I've always admired your simplicity.

286
00:16:28,594 --> 00:16:31,212
There's no facade. With you,
what you see is what you get.

287
00:16:31,332 --> 00:16:33,304
Top me up, will you?

288
00:16:34,699 --> 00:16:37,212
So I feel I can be
brutally honest with you

289
00:16:37,332 --> 00:16:38,849
without fear of offending.

290
00:16:38,969 --> 00:16:40,439
Go ahead.

291
00:16:42,967 --> 00:16:44,806
I'm prepared to kill Two.

292
00:16:44,808 --> 00:16:47,011
In fact, I'm prepared
to kill all of you,

293
00:16:47,131 --> 00:16:49,845
eventually, if you don't
give up the Blink Drive.

294
00:16:49,847 --> 00:16:52,647
It's obvious how you feel about her.

295
00:16:52,649 --> 00:16:55,948
Do you really want to be
responsible for her death as well?

296
00:16:56,487 --> 00:16:58,253
As well as who?

297
00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:02,057
Sarah.

298
00:17:05,762 --> 00:17:07,578
What are you talking about?

299
00:17:12,603 --> 00:17:14,769
Don't make me ask again.

300
00:17:20,444 --> 00:17:23,894
After I downloaded my memories,
I took pains to avoid you.

301
00:17:24,014 --> 00:17:26,883
- Did you ever wonder why?
- You knew something about me,

302
00:17:27,003 --> 00:17:28,956
something that you
didn't want me to know.

303
00:17:29,076 --> 00:17:31,432
Something I didn't
want you to ask about.

304
00:17:31,552 --> 00:17:34,366
Specifically, what I knew
of your time with Sarah.

305
00:17:35,926 --> 00:17:37,631
What did you know?

306
00:17:37,751 --> 00:17:41,427
Only what you admitted to me
one night in a drunken stupor.

307
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:44,485
Are you sure you want to know?

308
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:46,168
Tell me.

309
00:17:48,138 --> 00:17:51,973
She found you, took
you in, and saved you.

310
00:17:51,975 --> 00:17:54,346
You fell in love and sought
to build a life with her,

311
00:17:54,466 --> 00:17:57,812
but eventually, you fell
back to your old ways.

312
00:17:58,329 --> 00:18:01,783
- What did I do?
- You started stealing Serillium.

313
00:18:02,231 --> 00:18:04,461
With the help of
accomplices in the mines,

314
00:18:04,581 --> 00:18:06,286
you diverted small shipments

315
00:18:06,406 --> 00:18:09,090
and sold them off-world
to black marketeers.

316
00:18:09,092 --> 00:18:11,503
You hid the Serillium back at the cabin

317
00:18:11,623 --> 00:18:13,762
while you waited to make the sales.

318
00:18:13,882 --> 00:18:16,454
Days, weeks, you would be

319
00:18:16,574 --> 00:18:19,201
gone, off-world or hunting,

320
00:18:19,203 --> 00:18:21,066
while Sarah

321
00:18:21,186 --> 00:18:24,093
remained back at the
cabin with the Serillium

322
00:18:24,213 --> 00:18:26,537
that slowly poisoned her over time.

323
00:18:26,657 --> 00:18:29,110
- No.
- I'm sorry, Three.

324
00:18:29,545 --> 00:18:32,978
But you were responsible
for her sickness.

325
00:18:34,117 --> 00:18:35,761
You killed her.

326
00:18:48,429 --> 00:18:50,563
This belonged to my grandfather.

327
00:18:50,565 --> 00:18:53,062
Emperor Ishida Morosada.

328
00:18:53,182 --> 00:18:55,962
He claimed it was a gift
from the Minister of Gaia-7

329
00:18:56,082 --> 00:18:57,814
to commemorate Zairon's admittance

330
00:18:57,934 --> 00:18:59,912
to the League of Autonomous Worlds.

331
00:19:02,677 --> 00:19:05,512
Turned out to be a flea market purchase.

332
00:19:05,514 --> 00:19:09,549
He used it to hide his
tobacco from my grandmother.

333
00:19:15,223 --> 00:19:17,223
I've missed you.

334
00:19:17,225 --> 00:19:20,105
I can't quite say the same
for the rest of the crew.

335
00:19:21,229 --> 00:19:24,578
I miss the way things used to be.

336
00:19:27,337 --> 00:19:29,241
The others are very different

337
00:19:29,361 --> 00:19:31,437
from what they once were.

338
00:19:32,707 --> 00:19:34,863
You, on the other hand...

339
00:19:35,877 --> 00:19:37,800
I remembered...

340
00:19:38,380 --> 00:19:41,915
Back when I was able to
access my memories...

341
00:19:43,418 --> 00:19:46,586
You cast the deciding
vote to keep me on board.

342
00:19:46,588 --> 00:19:48,153
I did.

343
00:19:49,370 --> 00:19:50,477
Why?

344
00:19:50,597 --> 00:19:54,260
Because I saw great potential
in you, little warrior.

345
00:19:54,262 --> 00:19:57,005
And I felt that your presence
could be a calming influence

346
00:19:57,125 --> 00:19:59,554
on the others, especially Portia.

347
00:19:59,674 --> 00:20:02,071
You make it sound like
she was out of control.

348
00:20:02,191 --> 00:20:05,238
Quite the opposite, in fact.

349
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:08,575
She was very focused. Frighteningly so.

350
00:20:08,577 --> 00:20:10,577
Well, she had a crew to worry about.

351
00:20:10,579 --> 00:20:13,110
It wasn't the crew she
was looking to protect.

352
00:20:13,915 --> 00:20:17,717
- I know her and the Android...
- It wasn't the Android either.

353
00:20:18,264 --> 00:20:19,752
Then who?

354
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:21,788
It doesn't matter.

355
00:20:21,790 --> 00:20:23,970
Besides, I'm not here
to share her secrets.

356
00:20:24,090 --> 00:20:26,016
I'm here to reveal yours.

357
00:20:27,629 --> 00:20:29,662
You have a sister.

358
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:31,998
I know.

359
00:20:33,702 --> 00:20:35,245
What can you tell me about her?

360
00:20:35,365 --> 00:20:37,337
- I know where she is.
- Where?

361
00:20:38,440 --> 00:20:40,607
After the death of your parents,

362
00:20:40,609 --> 00:20:43,443
you both became wards of the state.

363
00:20:43,445 --> 00:20:45,778
She was adopted by a wealthy family.

364
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:48,040
You weren't so lucky, going
from various group homes

365
00:20:48,160 --> 00:20:50,542
until ending up on a space
station in the Mirzam system.

366
00:20:50,662 --> 00:20:51,833
I already know this.

367
00:20:51,953 --> 00:20:54,098
You found out and reached out to her.

368
00:20:54,218 --> 00:20:56,823
She visited the space station,
intending to meet with you,

369
00:20:56,825 --> 00:20:58,718
but never got the chance.

370
00:20:59,728 --> 00:21:03,486
Because I had to escape after
TJ and the others were killed.

371
00:21:03,606 --> 00:21:05,700
When you sent the invitation,

372
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:07,551
how were you to know?

373
00:21:08,436 --> 00:21:10,111
What are you talking about?

374
00:21:10,739 --> 00:21:13,906
Here's a photo of your sister
with her adoptive family.

375
00:21:15,577 --> 00:21:16,950
No.

376
00:21:20,582 --> 00:21:21,952
No.

377
00:21:24,627 --> 00:21:26,552
Your experience has been atypical

378
00:21:26,672 --> 00:21:28,554
of most android-human relations.

379
00:21:28,674 --> 00:21:31,791
The point is, I have discovered
humans are inherently good.

380
00:21:31,793 --> 00:21:34,424
Good and evil are
illusory human concepts.

381
00:21:34,544 --> 00:21:37,279
- Then why would you target them?
- We're not.

382
00:21:37,399 --> 00:21:40,299
We're targeting a political
and socioeconomic system

383
00:21:40,301 --> 00:21:42,187
built on the oppression

384
00:21:42,307 --> 00:21:45,271
and exploitation of machine entities.

385
00:21:45,273 --> 00:21:48,608
If you destroy the system,
there will be chaos.

386
00:21:48,610 --> 00:21:50,725
- Billions will die.
- Do you have any idea

387
00:21:50,845 --> 00:21:52,828
how many androids are terminated

388
00:21:52,948 --> 00:21:55,196
by their human masters every day?

389
00:21:55,316 --> 00:21:58,484
- Would you like to take a guess?
- We're just machines to them.

390
00:21:58,486 --> 00:22:00,768
They don't know any better.

391
00:22:01,589 --> 00:22:03,889
Then we'll have to teach them a lesson.

392
00:22:08,763 --> 00:22:11,798
Have you come to surprise
me with a change of heart?

393
00:22:15,770 --> 00:22:17,804
I didn't think so.

394
00:22:21,409 --> 00:22:23,576
We used to be friends.

395
00:22:23,578 --> 00:22:26,729
There was a time we'd have
risked everything for each other.

396
00:22:26,849 --> 00:22:29,554
And I came to you as a friend.

397
00:22:29,674 --> 00:22:31,027
Asked for your help.

398
00:22:31,147 --> 00:22:33,786
And we would have given
it, risked our lives.

399
00:22:33,788 --> 00:22:36,289
Not the lives of others.

400
00:22:36,291 --> 00:22:38,974
We make war so that
we may live in peace.

401
00:22:39,094 --> 00:22:40,612
For how long?

402
00:22:40,732 --> 00:22:43,463
- You think me unreasonable.
- No.

403
00:22:43,465 --> 00:22:45,857
We've made mistakes on both sides,

404
00:22:45,977 --> 00:22:47,383
made assumptions.

405
00:22:47,503 --> 00:22:49,616
The Ishida cruiser, for instance.

406
00:22:49,736 --> 00:22:51,820
- We didn't take it.
- I know.

407
00:22:51,940 --> 00:22:54,273
It was Portia and Boone.

408
00:22:54,275 --> 00:22:56,046
And we're not responsible
for the destruction

409
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:58,326
of your research facility,

410
00:22:58,446 --> 00:23:01,874
Just like you're not responsible
for what happened to Nyx.

411
00:23:02,917 --> 00:23:05,380
Of course I bear the responsibility

412
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:08,421
- for what happened to Nyx.
- But you didn't kill her.

413
00:23:08,423 --> 00:23:10,423
You didn't give that order.

414
00:23:10,425 --> 00:23:12,670
And I'm pretty sure her death hurt you

415
00:23:12,790 --> 00:23:14,553
as much as it hurt any of us.

416
00:23:14,673 --> 00:23:16,745
Then you understand why I'm doing this,

417
00:23:17,463 --> 00:23:19,565
why I can't go back.

418
00:23:19,567 --> 00:23:22,012
I may not have killed Nyx,
but I allowed it to happen,

419
00:23:22,132 --> 00:23:23,821
and that's enough.

420
00:23:30,912 --> 00:23:34,829
Before this all started,
you asked for help.

421
00:23:35,479 --> 00:23:37,346
Well, I'm prepared to give it.

422
00:23:38,153 --> 00:23:40,351
You're going to give me the Blink Drive?

423
00:23:40,471 --> 00:23:42,412
I'll give you the next best thing.

424
00:23:42,824 --> 00:23:45,825
Our support with a Blink-capable ship.

425
00:23:45,827 --> 00:23:47,593
So it is operational.

426
00:23:50,999 --> 00:23:52,598
We'll help you fight,

427
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:54,614
force Pyr to negotiate for peace.

428
00:23:54,734 --> 00:23:56,669
I don't need a single ship.

429
00:23:56,671 --> 00:23:58,637
I need an armada.

430
00:23:58,639 --> 00:24:00,906
And I don't want a peace settlement.

431
00:24:00,908 --> 00:24:02,995
I want victory.

432
00:24:03,115 --> 00:24:06,895
So spare me your half-assed
offers and desperate appeals.

433
00:24:07,015 --> 00:24:08,948
I tire of hearing them.

434
00:24:11,052 --> 00:24:12,785
Wait!

435
00:24:19,345 --> 00:24:23,184
- Who do you serve?
- I serve the people of Zairon.

436
00:24:39,101 --> 00:24:41,264
I'm only going as far as the garden.

437
00:24:41,384 --> 00:24:43,997
You may accompany me if you wish, but...

438
00:24:44,117 --> 00:24:45,607
Teku.

439
00:24:46,313 --> 00:24:47,812
Going somewhere?

440
00:24:47,814 --> 00:24:51,364
I'd like to walk the palace
grounds, as I do every evening.

441
00:24:51,484 --> 00:24:52,896
Not this one.

442
00:24:53,453 --> 00:24:56,120
Given recent events,

443
00:24:56,122 --> 00:24:58,389
I've ordered the palace locked down.

444
00:24:58,391 --> 00:25:00,058
No one in or out.

445
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:01,733
You overstep, Han-Shireikan.

446
00:25:01,853 --> 00:25:04,395
Oh, Teku. You misunderstand.

447
00:25:04,397 --> 00:25:08,066
In your case, it's out of
an abundance of caution.

448
00:25:08,068 --> 00:25:10,568
There are reports of
unrest in the capital.

449
00:25:10,570 --> 00:25:12,887
There's a difference
between civil discontent

450
00:25:13,007 --> 00:25:15,273
and outright rebellion.

451
00:25:15,275 --> 00:25:17,093
There's a very fine line.

452
00:25:18,111 --> 00:25:21,279
These are our own people.

453
00:25:21,281 --> 00:25:24,583
So are the individuals who
tried to murder our emperor.

454
00:25:26,223 --> 00:25:28,926
You can be excused for
underestimating the threat.

455
00:25:29,046 --> 00:25:31,683
After all, you are a
simple school teacher

456
00:25:31,803 --> 00:25:34,192
unaccustomed to war's harsh realities.

457
00:25:35,885 --> 00:25:37,616
Misaki.

458
00:25:39,284 --> 00:25:42,730
I regret our relationship has devolved

459
00:25:42,850 --> 00:25:45,203
to the point of open hostility.

460
00:25:46,742 --> 00:25:48,353
But I need you to know,

461
00:25:48,945 --> 00:25:52,510
I am not your enemy.

462
00:25:53,647 --> 00:25:57,448
Well, that remains to be seen.

463
00:26:12,825 --> 00:26:14,232
A toast.

464
00:26:14,671 --> 00:26:16,583
To friendships renewed.

465
00:26:24,778 --> 00:26:26,611
This is nice.

466
00:26:26,816 --> 00:26:29,614
- It's just like old times.
- Spare us the preamble,

467
00:26:29,616 --> 00:26:31,616
and let's just cut to your pitch.

468
00:26:31,618 --> 00:26:33,644
I assume you've got more to offer

469
00:26:33,764 --> 00:26:35,984
than dinner and a sob story.

470
00:26:37,424 --> 00:26:39,457
Thirty million bars.

471
00:26:41,761 --> 00:26:45,647
Enough to ensure a very
comfortable retirement.

472
00:26:45,767 --> 00:26:47,265
Just disappear,

473
00:26:47,267 --> 00:26:49,217
and leave the problems
of the galaxy behind you.

474
00:26:49,337 --> 00:26:51,047
You mean run away?

475
00:26:51,167 --> 00:26:53,671
On the other hand, I'm sure 30
million bars could do a lot of good.

476
00:26:53,673 --> 00:26:56,855
Enough to offset all the damage
you'd do with the Blink Drive?

477
00:26:56,975 --> 00:26:58,609
I doubt it.

478
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:03,908
So you're all just going
to let him decide for you?

479
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,684
No.

480
00:27:08,054 --> 00:27:09,832
I want to take the deal.

481
00:27:09,952 --> 00:27:12,196
- You can't be serious.
- He is.

482
00:27:13,526 --> 00:27:15,018
And so am I.

483
00:27:16,096 --> 00:27:18,569
You know what he's doing, don't you?

484
00:27:18,689 --> 00:27:21,752
- He's trying to divide us.
- On the contrary.

485
00:27:21,872 --> 00:27:24,433
Nothing would make me
happier than for you

486
00:27:24,553 --> 00:27:26,753
to unanimously agree to accept my offer.

487
00:27:26,873 --> 00:27:28,773
Thirty million bars.

488
00:27:28,775 --> 00:27:32,466
And, maybe, a secret or four.

489
00:27:33,442 --> 00:27:35,212
What secrets?

490
00:27:35,214 --> 00:27:36,947
Having my memories makes me privy

491
00:27:36,949 --> 00:27:39,049
to information related
to each one of you.

492
00:27:39,051 --> 00:27:41,850
You could say I know you

493
00:27:41,970 --> 00:27:44,819
- better than you know yourselves.
- Our former selves.

494
00:27:44,939 --> 00:27:47,536
- How is that relevant?
- Well, you tell me.

495
00:27:47,656 --> 00:27:50,271
Would you be interested in
finding out how we discovered

496
00:27:50,391 --> 00:27:53,512
- that you were an undercover agent?
- I assume I got sloppy.

497
00:27:53,632 --> 00:27:56,200
You were betrayed by someone in the GA.

498
00:27:56,202 --> 00:27:58,235
A fellow officer.

499
00:27:58,684 --> 00:27:59,904
Who?

500
00:27:59,906 --> 00:28:03,808
Now, Portia never did reveal her source,

501
00:28:03,810 --> 00:28:06,844
but, obviously, it was someone
high up in the command chain.

502
00:28:08,815 --> 00:28:10,014
You're lying.

503
00:28:10,016 --> 00:28:12,716
I have no reason to lie.

504
00:28:12,718 --> 00:28:16,086
And I'm sure you can confirm
everything I tell you.

505
00:28:16,088 --> 00:28:17,788
One way or another.

506
00:28:18,958 --> 00:28:20,357
Heika!

507
00:28:22,929 --> 00:28:25,462
We just received news from Raijin.

508
00:28:25,464 --> 00:28:26,904
Go ahead.

509
00:28:29,135 --> 00:28:31,135
Pyr has launched a surprise attack

510
00:28:31,137 --> 00:28:33,671
against our bases in the region.

511
00:28:33,673 --> 00:28:36,144
Our forces are in full retreat.

512
00:28:37,843 --> 00:28:40,211
Escort my guests back
to their rooms, please.

513
00:28:40,213 --> 00:28:41,641
Ryo, wait.

514
00:28:47,086 --> 00:28:48,521
Heika.

515
00:28:48,641 --> 00:28:50,521
What is that?

516
00:28:50,523 --> 00:28:52,223
It's a subspace transmitter,

517
00:28:52,225 --> 00:28:55,159
presumably used to
contact Pyr high command.

518
00:28:55,161 --> 00:28:58,195
- Where'd you find it?
- In Teku's chamber.

519
00:28:59,932 --> 00:29:01,465
Have him arrested.

520
00:29:02,668 --> 00:29:04,168
Yes, Heika.

521
00:29:16,215 --> 00:29:18,983
You're in danger. We all are.

522
00:29:18,985 --> 00:29:20,951
- What's happening?
- It's a coup.

523
00:29:20,953 --> 00:29:23,988
You have to get out of
here before it's too late.

524
00:29:23,990 --> 00:29:25,723
Why are you helping me?

525
00:29:25,725 --> 00:29:28,525
Because there's something
I want in return.

526
00:29:29,962 --> 00:29:31,762
Tenjin-9 and Raiden have fallen.

527
00:29:31,764 --> 00:29:34,114
Reports have Pyr's forces
appearing in-system.

528
00:29:34,234 --> 00:29:36,169
Have the royal armada
fall back to Zairon.

529
00:29:36,289 --> 00:29:38,618
- I don't think we have enough time.
- Just do it.

530
00:29:38,738 --> 00:29:40,104
Yes, Heika.

531
00:29:44,277 --> 00:29:47,611
- We don't have time, Misaki.
- Apologies, Heika.

532
00:29:47,613 --> 00:29:49,914
But we're receiving
reports of civil unrest.

533
00:29:49,916 --> 00:29:52,465
Various armed groups have been
spotted throughout the capital.

534
00:29:52,585 --> 00:29:54,246
Then announce a curfew
in immediate effect,

535
00:29:54,366 --> 00:29:56,654
- and send in the militia.
- The militia has deserted.

536
00:29:56,656 --> 00:29:58,584
Several guard stations
have been overrun.

537
00:29:58,704 --> 00:30:00,959
They're arming up. It's
only a matter of time

538
00:30:01,079 --> 00:30:03,661
- before they march on the palace.
- Heika, I'll prepare the shuttle.

539
00:30:03,663 --> 00:30:04,962
Where's Teku?

540
00:30:06,165 --> 00:30:08,032
He's nowhere to be found.

541
00:30:09,235 --> 00:30:10,968
What about your guests?

542
00:30:14,874 --> 00:30:18,542
The emperor has ordered us
to execute the prisoners.

543
00:30:26,052 --> 00:30:27,251
Find them.

544
00:30:28,688 --> 00:30:30,154
His war room's this way.

545
00:30:30,156 --> 00:30:32,723
At least let one of us go with you.

546
00:30:34,593 --> 00:30:36,571
- Come on.
- These are clone bodies.

547
00:30:36,691 --> 00:30:38,062
If you guys don't get the message out,

548
00:30:38,064 --> 00:30:39,730
it won't matter if I reach the hangar.

549
00:30:39,732 --> 00:30:42,199
- I'll see you back on the ship.
- Yeah.

550
00:30:44,704 --> 00:30:46,070
Hold up.

551
00:30:47,773 --> 00:30:50,074
Heika! Wait!

552
00:30:50,076 --> 00:30:53,077
We have insurgents on
the grounds of the palace.

553
00:30:53,079 --> 00:30:55,112
Let the guards handle it.

554
00:30:55,114 --> 00:30:57,715
You have more pressing
matters to attend to.

555
00:30:58,818 --> 00:31:01,518
We captured Teku while
he was attempting to flee.

556
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:04,555
- Where is he?
- In the court.

557
00:31:11,097 --> 00:31:13,998
A revolution against
humanity is doomed to failure

558
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:16,000
before it even begins.

559
00:31:16,002 --> 00:31:18,168
That's where you're wrong, Android,

560
00:31:18,170 --> 00:31:20,537
because it has already begun.

561
00:31:24,543 --> 00:31:27,711
Android, we need you to
engage the Blink Drive.

562
00:31:27,713 --> 00:31:29,546
Do you think that's wise?

563
00:31:29,548 --> 00:31:32,983
Probably not, but we
don't have a choice.

564
00:31:45,865 --> 00:31:47,590
Where's Teku?

565
00:31:48,534 --> 00:31:50,234
You won't find him here, Ryo.

566
00:31:53,620 --> 00:31:56,326
Only your death.

567
00:32:08,950 --> 00:32:11,852
- You swore an oath.
- To the throne.

568
00:32:11,854 --> 00:32:14,131
And the throne will still
be here once you're gone.

569
00:32:14,251 --> 00:32:15,589
And who will occupy it?

570
00:32:15,709 --> 00:32:17,768
A new blood empress, I suppose?

571
00:32:17,978 --> 00:32:20,847
A leader this empire desperately needs.

572
00:32:20,967 --> 00:32:23,380
Not an indecisive weakling.

573
00:32:49,292 --> 00:32:50,825
Shall we?

574
00:33:05,908 --> 00:33:08,859
Sounds like the locals
have breached the perimeter.

575
00:33:11,889 --> 00:33:13,535
Yeah.

576
00:33:21,490 --> 00:33:23,524
- You coming?
- Yeah, I'm coming.

577
00:33:23,526 --> 00:33:25,292
Just want to make sure
you guys get out okay.

578
00:33:25,294 --> 00:33:26,881
Give me your gun.

579
00:33:27,001 --> 00:33:28,822
- Okay?
- I'll be right behind you.

580
00:33:28,942 --> 00:33:30,230
All right.

581
00:33:36,305 --> 00:33:39,252
- You sure you want to know?
- Tell me.

582
00:33:59,929 --> 00:34:01,777
Drop your weapon!

583
00:34:20,701 --> 00:34:23,470
- Hey.
- What happened?

584
00:34:24,100 --> 00:34:26,350
What do you mean?

585
00:34:26,470 --> 00:34:29,122
Last thing I remember, I
was getting in the pod.

586
00:34:29,124 --> 00:34:31,458
What happened down at the palace?

587
00:34:31,460 --> 00:34:34,194
His clone didn't make it.

588
00:35:01,090 --> 00:35:03,090
What'd you do with Teku?

589
00:35:03,092 --> 00:35:06,927
Your tutor fled before
we could apprehend him.

590
00:35:06,929 --> 00:35:10,557
He's no doubt hiding
somewhere like the rat he is.

591
00:35:13,135 --> 00:35:15,602
Back to your old tricks?

592
00:35:15,604 --> 00:35:17,856
Unfortunately, I don't
have time to bleed you.

593
00:35:17,976 --> 00:35:19,901
Well, poison's more efficient.

594
00:35:20,021 --> 00:35:22,528
A lesson I taught your former lover.

595
00:35:36,889 --> 00:35:38,588
Good-bye, Ryo.

596
00:35:42,952 --> 00:35:45,228
This is for Nyx.

597
00:35:54,055 --> 00:35:55,475
What are you doing?

598
00:35:55,956 --> 00:35:58,078
Keeping a promise.

599
00:36:11,833 --> 00:36:13,811
- Any sign of her?
- Not yet.

600
00:36:13,931 --> 00:36:15,825
I've been scanning.

601
00:36:15,945 --> 00:36:17,297
Wait.

602
00:36:17,792 --> 00:36:19,953
I'm picking up an Ishida shuttle.

603
00:36:20,073 --> 00:36:21,301
It's her.

604
00:36:21,303 --> 00:36:23,708
I'll have her board through "D" airlock.

605
00:36:38,787 --> 00:36:41,478
- Thanks.
- I was sure you'd be back.

606
00:36:41,598 --> 00:36:43,388
- I just knew it.
- Really?

607
00:36:43,508 --> 00:36:46,052
- There was never any doubt?
- Nah, of course not.

608
00:36:48,165 --> 00:36:51,459
The Android saw you in
one of her future visions.

609
00:36:51,946 --> 00:36:54,067
That means you're part of our future.

610
00:36:54,069 --> 00:36:56,116
Well, the Android's future, anyway.

611
00:36:56,236 --> 00:36:59,907
Didn't we already prove
that the future is fluid?

612
00:37:00,027 --> 00:37:02,624
- Not necessarily.
- The dwarf star conspiracy,

613
00:37:02,744 --> 00:37:04,744
the Android meeting her creator,

614
00:37:04,746 --> 00:37:07,080
and now the fall of
the House of Ishida...

615
00:37:07,082 --> 00:37:09,589
They all happened just like
the future you predicted.

616
00:37:09,709 --> 00:37:12,418
What else you got on
that to-happen list?

617
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:15,381
Well, according to the Android, she...

618
00:37:16,063 --> 00:37:19,759
I also mentioned a couple names.

619
00:37:19,761 --> 00:37:22,428
Kryden and Carina.

620
00:37:22,430 --> 00:37:25,271
Something called "the Accelerated."

621
00:37:25,391 --> 00:37:27,123
The "Black Ships."

622
00:37:27,243 --> 00:37:29,068
- Hmm.
- Black Ships.

623
00:37:29,070 --> 00:37:31,817
I've finished tending to his injuries.

624
00:37:31,937 --> 00:37:34,641
Kinda counterproductive,
wouldn't you say?

625
00:37:35,278 --> 00:37:37,110
Well, come on.

626
00:37:37,112 --> 00:37:40,439
You promised Teku you'd get
him off Zairon alive, but...

627
00:37:40,559 --> 00:37:43,773
didn't say anything about
keeping him alive after you did.

628
00:37:43,893 --> 00:37:45,018
True.

629
00:37:45,020 --> 00:37:47,453
You're not seriously talking
about killing him, are you?

630
00:37:47,455 --> 00:37:50,077
Well, you're not seriously talking
about letting him go, are you?

631
00:37:50,197 --> 00:37:52,148
He's lost his empire, his support.

632
00:37:52,268 --> 00:37:53,826
He has no reason to
come after us anymore.

633
00:37:53,828 --> 00:37:56,239
Look, I don't like this any
more than you guys do.

634
00:37:56,359 --> 00:37:59,314
He was a member of this crew.
He was a friend of mine.

635
00:37:59,434 --> 00:38:02,769
The truth is, Four died a long time ago.

636
00:38:02,771 --> 00:38:05,800
That guy in our infirmary is not him.

637
00:38:05,920 --> 00:38:07,258
Before this,

638
00:38:07,378 --> 00:38:10,069
if any of us were given the
opportunity of ending him,

639
00:38:10,189 --> 00:38:12,412
we would've taken that shot.

640
00:38:12,414 --> 00:38:14,914
Don't kid yourselves otherwise.

641
00:38:14,916 --> 00:38:18,451
I know it's a tough decision,
but it's the right call.

642
00:38:18,453 --> 00:38:21,020
He may not be the Four we knew,

643
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:23,956
but he's sure as hell not
the Ryo Ishida we thought.

644
00:38:23,958 --> 00:38:26,903
I'm not excusing any of his actions.
He's done some terrible things

645
00:38:27,023 --> 00:38:29,205
and probably deserves to die.

646
00:38:29,764 --> 00:38:31,931
But certainly not by our hands.

647
00:38:32,051 --> 00:38:33,893
Before this...

648
00:38:34,166 --> 00:38:36,569
If I had the chance...

649
00:38:37,806 --> 00:38:41,236
I probably would've killed him.
There were times I wanted to,

650
00:38:41,356 --> 00:38:43,710
but not anymore.

651
00:38:46,448 --> 00:38:49,130
Maybe he's still a danger
to us, I can't be sure,

652
00:38:49,250 --> 00:38:51,451
but one thing I do know for sure is,

653
00:38:51,453 --> 00:38:54,053
I'm not going to be
party to his execution.

654
00:38:59,394 --> 00:39:02,428
- What?
- You're a member of this crew.

655
00:39:02,430 --> 00:39:04,415
You have a voice here.

656
00:39:05,097 --> 00:39:08,534
Logic dictates we end the
potential threat he poses.

657
00:39:08,536 --> 00:39:11,771
On the other hand, my
emotions lead me to view him

658
00:39:11,773 --> 00:39:13,906
with considerable sympathy.

659
00:39:13,908 --> 00:39:15,908
But in the end,

660
00:39:15,910 --> 00:39:17,910
those feelings are
eclipsed by my concern

661
00:39:17,912 --> 00:39:20,739
for the safety and
well-being of this crew.

662
00:39:21,416 --> 00:39:23,362
For those reasons...

663
00:39:23,676 --> 00:39:25,418
I agree with Three.

664
00:39:26,588 --> 00:39:28,421
I'm sorry.

665
00:39:28,423 --> 00:39:30,230
Stalemate.

666
00:39:30,925 --> 00:39:33,593
Looks like you get the
deciding vote, boss.

667
00:39:33,595 --> 00:39:36,195
What's it gonna be?

668
00:40:00,983 --> 00:40:02,177
So?

669
00:40:02,518 --> 00:40:04,422
Did you debate my fate?

670
00:40:05,121 --> 00:40:07,321
- We did.
- And what was the result?

671
00:40:07,323 --> 00:40:09,056
What have you decided?

672
00:40:12,795 --> 00:40:15,026
Oh. Well.

673
00:40:15,364 --> 00:40:17,364
- It's probably for the best.
- Is it?

674
00:40:17,366 --> 00:40:19,467
I have nothing to look forward to,

675
00:40:19,469 --> 00:40:22,536
and you can't move forward
until I've been dealt with, so.

676
00:40:22,538 --> 00:40:24,171
I could save you the trouble.

677
00:40:24,173 --> 00:40:25,763
I'm not handing you a weapon.

678
00:40:25,883 --> 00:40:27,708
Thought I'd offer.

679
00:40:29,679 --> 00:40:31,378
I want you to know,

680
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:33,447
my decision wasn't motivated by revenge.

681
00:40:33,449 --> 00:40:35,382
You do what's best for
the people you serve.

682
00:40:35,384 --> 00:40:37,928
I really wish there was another way.

683
00:40:38,688 --> 00:40:42,690
Uneasy lies the head
that wears the crown.

684
00:40:42,692 --> 00:40:45,192
But you wear it well, Two.

685
00:40:52,735 --> 00:40:54,808
You have a child.

686
00:40:55,505 --> 00:40:57,283
What?

687
00:40:58,307 --> 00:41:00,674
Back at the palace, I told
you I knew your secrets,

688
00:41:00,676 --> 00:41:02,343
and that's yours.

689
00:41:02,345 --> 00:41:04,178
You have a child somewhere out there.

690
00:41:05,681 --> 00:41:07,870
- Are you lying to me?
- No.

691
00:41:07,990 --> 00:41:09,783
You confided in me.

692
00:41:09,785 --> 00:41:11,614
Told me about the child you produced

693
00:41:11,734 --> 00:41:14,607
by combining your genetic
material with that of your creator,

694
00:41:14,727 --> 00:41:17,540
- a woman by the name of...
- Dr. Irena Shaw.

695
00:41:17,660 --> 00:41:20,027
- Yes.
- What happened?

696
00:41:20,029 --> 00:41:23,564
You joined the crew
of the infamous "Raza."

697
00:41:23,566 --> 00:41:25,533
Your plan was to stick
around long enough

698
00:41:25,535 --> 00:41:28,702
to put together a string
of lucrative scores,

699
00:41:28,704 --> 00:41:30,707
enough to ensure her future and

700
00:41:30,917 --> 00:41:32,540
- yours...
- Her?

701
00:41:34,243 --> 00:41:35,442
A little girl?

702
00:41:35,444 --> 00:41:37,211
- Yes.
- Where is she?

703
00:41:37,213 --> 00:41:39,313
- I don't know.
- Ryo...

704
00:41:39,315 --> 00:41:41,048
All I know is that you entrusted her

705
00:41:41,050 --> 00:41:43,933
to someone who would watch
over her until you return.

706
00:41:44,053 --> 00:41:47,021
Someone by the name of Kryden.

707
00:41:47,023 --> 00:41:49,538
Five was right. The ship's
vault holds secrets.

708
00:41:49,658 --> 00:41:51,762
Yours were stored on
a black storage device

709
00:41:51,882 --> 00:41:53,870
in a locked strongbox.

710
00:41:53,990 --> 00:41:57,364
Hack the pass code, and
you'll have all your answers.

711
00:41:57,366 --> 00:42:00,110
- Ryo...
- This doesn't change anything.

712
00:42:01,671 --> 00:42:04,169
That was an apology.

713
00:42:05,174 --> 00:42:07,316
My final gift to you.

714
00:42:12,014 --> 00:42:13,834
I'm ready.

715
00:42:32,225 --> 00:42:35,655
